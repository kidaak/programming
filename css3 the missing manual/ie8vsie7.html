	<p>Because IE 8 is still very popular, you need to keep a couple of things in mind. IE 8
		is sort of like a chameleon: It can take on the appearance of a different version. If
		you’re not careful, it may not display your web pages the way you want it to. For
		example, and most importantly, you must include a proper doctype. As mentioned
		in the previous section, without a doctype, browsers switch into quirks mode. Well,
		when IE 8 goes into quirks mode, it tries to replicate the look of IE 5 (!?).
		But wait—there’s more! IE 8 can also pretend to be IE 7. When someone viewing your
		site in IE 8 clicks a “compatibility view” button, IE 8 goes into IE 7 mode, displaying
		pages without IE 8’s full CSS 2.1 goodness. The same thing happens if Microsoft
		puts your website onto its Compatibility View List—a list of sites that Microsoft
		has determined look better in IE 7 than in IE 8. If you’re designing a site using the
		guidelines in this book, you won’t want IE 8 to act like IE 7…ever.
		Fortunately, there’s a way to tell IE 8 to stop all this nonsense and just be IE 8. Adding
		a single META tag to a web page instructs IE 8 to ignore Compatibility View and the
		Compatibility View List and always display the page by using its most standardscompliant
		mode:</p>
		<code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" /&gt;</code>
		<p>Put this instruction in the page’s &lt;head&gt; section (below the &lt;title&gt; tag is a good
			place). This tag works for current versions of IE, too: The "IE=edge" part of the tag
			will instruct versions of Internet Explorer later than IE 8 to also display web pages
			in their standard mode. Unfortunately, you must do this on every page of your site.</p>
