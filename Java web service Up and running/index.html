		<p>Sử dụng <em>wsimport</em> để tạo Client và truy cập Webservice</p>
		- Sử dụng lệnh sau: <br>
		<code>wsimport -d directory -p package -keep URL</code><br>
		Example: <br>
		<code>wsimport -d D:\ -p client -keep http://localhost:8080/random/rs?wsdl</code>

		<h2>The WSDL Service Contract in Detail</h2>
		<p>The document or root element is named definitions. This is appropriate because
			the WSDL defines the web service thoroughly enough that utilities such as wsimport
			can use the WSDL to generate code, typically but not exclusively client-side
			support code.</p>
			<p>
				The first child element of definitions, named types, is technically optional but
				almost always present in a modern WSDL. This element contains (or links to) an
				XML Schema or the equivalent—a grammar that specifies the data types for the
				messages involved in the service. In a modern SOAP-based web service, the arguments
				passed to web service operations are typed—but the SOAP messages themselves
				are also typed. For this reason, the receiver of a SOAP message can check,
				typically at the library level, whether the received message satisfies the constraints
				that the message’s type impose.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next come one or more message elements, which list the messages whose data types
				are given in the types section immediately above. Every message has a corresponding
				complexType entry in the schema from the types section, assuming that
				the types section is nonempty.
			</p>
			<p>
				The portType section comes next. There is always exactly one portType element.
				The portType is essentially the service interface: a specification of the service’s operations
				and the message patterns that the operations exemplify. For example, in
				the request/response pattern, the client begins the conversation with a request
				message and the service counters with a response message. In the solicit/response
				pattern, by contrast, the service starts the conversation with a solicitation message
				and the client counters with a response. There is also the one-way pattern (client
				to server only) and the notification pattern (server to client only). Richer conversational
				patterns can be built out of these simpler ones. The message items in the
				preceding section are the components of an operation, and the portType section
				defines an operation by placing message items in a specific order
			</p>
			<p>
				Next come one or more binding sections, which provide implementation detail
				such as the transport used in the service (for instance, HTTP rather than SMTP),
				the service style, and the SOAP version (that is, 1.1 or 1.2). By default, Java generates
				a single binding section but DotNet generates two: one for SOAP 1.1 and another
				for SOAP 1.2.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last section, named service, brings all of the previous details together to define
				key attributes such as the service endpoint—that is, the URL at which the service
				can be accessed. Nested in the service element are one or more port subelements,
				where a port is a portType plus a binding:
				port = portType + binding
				Since there is only one portType in a WSDL, the number of port subelements equals
				the number of binding elements.
